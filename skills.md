## Agent Assignments

### 🔧 DevOps-Git-02 — `file-patching`, `git-skill`

| Requested Skill | Status | Nearest Match | Repo Path |
|---|---|---|---|
| `file-patching` | ⚠️ NOT FOUND | *None in repo* | — |
| `git-skill` | ⚠️ NOT FOUND | *None in repo* | — |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Neither `file-patching` nor `git-skill` exist in the skills repository. **DevOps-Git-02** must use native Git/patch tooling (e.g., `git apply`, `git diff`) directly rather than relying on packaged skills. These capabilities are built into the agent runtime.
